  Hi, I am Mpilo Khumalo.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am an Ecosystems Ecologist. I am currently doing a PhD at Stellenbosch University looking at all the processes and conditions that occur during the formation of wood in forest trees. 

Outside my research, I help people and organisations make data-driven decisions, high quality data visualisations, data analytics mostly using literate programming and advanced statistics. I also like learning new skills and teaching them to other people.
