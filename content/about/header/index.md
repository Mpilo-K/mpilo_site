<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am an __Ecosystems Ecologist __. I am currently doing a PhD at Stellenbosch University. My current research is a big project called __[The EucXylo Phenomenological Trial](https://blogs.sun.ac.za/eucxylo/2020/10/12/the-beginning-of-our-phenomenological-trial/)__ where I am studying all the ecophysiological processes and conditions that occur during the formation of wood in forest trees.  

Outside my research, I freelance as a __Data Analyst__ where I help people and organisations make data-driven decisions using high quality data, high quality visualisations and advanced data analytics.I love programming in __R__, __MySQL__ and __Python__, especially literate programming in __Rmarkdown__, __Jupyter Notebooks__ and __LaTex__. I also teach these tools and skills to beginners.

In my free time, I enjoy mountain cycling, calisthenics, climbing rocks and mountains, playing a Ukulele, learning new languages (currently Deutsch).
