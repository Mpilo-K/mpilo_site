  I am an **Ecosystems Ecologist _(Ecophysiologist)_**. I am currently doing a PhD at Stellenbosch University. My current research is a big project called __[The EucXylo Phenomenological Trial](https://blogs.sun.ac.za/eucxylo/2020/10/12/the-beginning-of-our-phenomenological-trial/)__ where I am studying all the ecophysiological processes and conditions that occur during the formation of wood in forest trees.  
  
  Outside my research, I freelance as a __Data Analyst__ where I help people and organisations make data-driven decisions using high quality data, state-of-the-art visualisations and advanced data analytics. I love programming in __R__, __MySQL__ and __Python__, especially literate programming in __Rmarkdown__, __Jupyter Notebooks__ and __LaTex__. I also teach these tools and skills to beginners. 
  
  In my free time, I enjoy mountain cycling, calisthenics, climbing rocks and mountains, playing a Ukulele, learning new languages (currently Deutsch).
  
  I write a **blog** about _Science, Programming, Travel, Cycling, Hiking, Survival Camping_ etc. I also showcase my **projects** and public **talks**. See highlights below and click on the tabs at the top for more details. Feel free to **contact** me.
